# covid_california_scrape
 A webscraper of all the Public Health websites in California about COVID_19.
 Returns a csv file of DAILY data in the format of
 "date,county,cases,deaths,tests,recovered.

 Not all county websites are able to be scraped. These county will have NAN files.
 In the 'California Counties Notebook', there are some work arounds for some of
 these counties. Saving a webfile of the website (see folder webpages), and
 then scraping the website with Beautiful Soup is one such workaround. I plan
 to add a workaround file after I brush up on some skills.

 Other county websites use images or dashboards to give updates on the latest
 covid data and accessing the website is your best bet.  

 Stay tuned for dashboards and graphics, but please start using the data to make
 your own.
